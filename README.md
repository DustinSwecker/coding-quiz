# Created quiz to test coding knowledge

## Added coding quiz with multiple javascript generated pages

As students need to continue to hone their knowledge and sharpen their coding tools, I created a web site for students to test their knowledge.


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Upon clicking a start button, the web page generates additional pages by use of JavaScript. Once the quiz is done, the page compiles a score based on the time left from a timer that begins upon pressing the start button, saves the scores to local and generates a High Scores page to promote competition.
